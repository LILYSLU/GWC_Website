Animes I Recommend (In no particular order):
  <dt> 1) Jutjutsu Kaisen- the above photo is from the anime! Recommend for new watchers, facinating storylines, action packed fighting scenes, and magic.</dt>

  <dt> 2) Hunter x Hunter- although it's a pretty long, uncompleted anime, Hunter x Hunter is one of a kind with completely distinct characters that might just make you cry. Recommend for those who went through a pokemon phase or for ones who love any sort of adventure!</dt>

  <dt> 3) Violet Evergarden- short and mesmerizing, Violet Evergarden is probably one of the most well animated animes Netflix and any other studio created. With a heartful theme, this one will definitely make you cry.
  
  <dt> 4) Banana Fish- A heartbreaking and soul-crushing anime that will probably change you for good. </dt>
